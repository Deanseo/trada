<p>
When I was a kid, I got sick once and my doctor gave me a 10mg of Cetirizine, a very common anti-histamine pill that you can even buy at a 7/11 today.
After taking the pill, I felt sleepy.
</p>

<p>
I told my doctor about it and he explained that still, Cetirizine was the best choice, saying other similar medicines would make me even more drowsy, 
</p>

<p>
At the time, I didn't really understand why a pill would have that side effect.
I mean, I thought it would make me feel more <i>energetic</i>&#x2026;? because I assumed it would kill those "<i>evil allergy germs</i>," so I should get <i>helthier</i>, right?
</p>

<p>
Of course, now I know there's no such thing as evil allergy germs.
Certain drugs make us feel:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Tired</li>
<li>Excited</li>
<li>Awake</li>
</ul>

<p>
There have been many studies describing why that happens.
Although it's a complicated matter, the (superficial) mechanism itself is simple. It all comes down to how our "brain" works!
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="bbbblood-brain-barrier">BBB(Blood-Brain Barrier)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-bbbblood-brain-barrier">
<p>
Our brain has a barrier that selectively allows certain substances to pass from the bloodstream into the brain. 
The <b>Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB)</b> is this selective barrier that separates the blood from the brain's extracellular fluid in the CNS(Central Nervous System).
</p>

<p>
Its main function is to protect the brain from harmful substances while allowing essential nutrients to enter.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Generally, lipid-soluble molecules, which are "oil-friendly," can pass through the BBB, whereas water-soluble molecules cannot. <br />
Some drugs can unintentionally cross the BBB, while other drugs (mostly psychoactive ones) are specifically designed to do so.
</p>

<h4 id="cetirizine">Cetirizine</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-cetirizine">
<p>
Cetirizine, one of the most commonly-used antihistamines, is the example that first comes to my mind to write this article.
It can cause drowsiness, although it's generally considered <i>less sedating</i> than those <i>first-generation</i> antihistamines, which are often avodied due to their stronger sedative effects.
</p>

<p>
Although it is indeed far less lipid-soluble, small amounts can still cross the BBB and enter the CNS.
</p>

<p>
One of the important roles Histamine plays is that it regulates wakefulness and alertness in the brain.
Therefore, Cetirizine blocking histamine H1 receptors in the CNS, even to a small extent, would result in drowsiness and sedation.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-diphenhydramine" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="diphenhydramine">Diphenhydramine</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-diphenhydramine">
<p>
Diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine with significant anticholinergic effects.
Although labled as an antihistamine, it's now more commonly used as a sleep inducer today.
</p>

<p>
Its strong anticholinergic properties and chronic use have been linked to a noticibly increased risk of dementia.

</p>

<p>
In my opinion, it's unfortunate that in most countries you can buy this without doctor's prescription considering the risk after a long term use is significant.

<h6 id="connection-to-dementia">Anticholinergic drugs connected to dementia</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-connection-to-dementia">
<p>
Several studies have indicated that long-term use of those anticholinergic drugs is <i>strongly</i> associated with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7821204/">dementia</a>.

<div id="outline-container-adderall" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="adderall">Adderall</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-adderall">
<p>
Similarly, Adderall is designed to cross the BBB, promote the release of dopamine and and norepinephrine, and inhibit their reuptake.
</p>

<p>
That results in a hyper-alertness, stronger than the <i>regular</i> alertness caused by caffeine as described above, which merely blocks some adenosine receptors.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-caffein-and-coffee" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="caffein-and-coffee">Caffeine and coffee</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-caffein-and-coffee">
<p>
Arguably, the most loved drug among people today is coffee, though you don't need a doctor's prescription.
Caffeine found in coffee can cross the BBB and block adenosine receptors.
</p>

<p>
Adenosine promotes calmness, but when caffeine blocks its receptors, your brain can't calm down, resulting in a state of alertness.
Too much caffeine can lead to excessive alertness, causing side effects like insomnia, as shown below:

<p>
The BBB is a critical protective system in the brain that maintains its delicate environment by selectively regulating what substances can enter the CNS.
That highlights the need for careful management of medications we take in order to ensure they are used safely and effectively.
