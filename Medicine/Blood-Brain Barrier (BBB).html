<p>
When I was a kid, I got sick once and my doctor gave me a 10mg of Cetirizine, a very common anti-histamine pill that you can even buy at a 7/11 today.
After taking the pill, I felt sleepy.
</p>

<p>
I told my doctor about it and he explained that still, Cetirizine was the best choice, saying other similar medicines would make me even more drowsy, 
</p>

<p>
At the time, I didn't really understand why a pill would have that side effect.
I mean, I thought it should make me feel more <i>energetic</i>&#x2026;? because it's supposed to kill those "evil allergy germs," so I get <i>helthier</i>, right?
</p>

<p>
Of course, now I know there's no such thing as evil allergy germs.
Certain drugs make us feel:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Tired</li>
<li>Excited</li>
<li>Awake</li>
</ul>

<p>
There have been many studies describing why that happens.
Although it's a complicated matter, the (superficial) mechanism itself is simple. It all comes down to how our "brain" works!
</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-bbbblood-brain-barrier">
<p>
Our brain has a barrier that selectively allows certain substances to pass from the bloodstream into the brain. 
The <b>Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB)</b> is this selective barrier that separates the blood from the brain's extracellular fluid in the CNS(Central Nervous System).
</p>

<p>
Its main function is to protect the brain from harmful substances while allowing essential nutrients to enter.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Generally, lipid-soluble molecules, which are "oil-friendly," can pass through the BBB, whereas water-soluble molecules cannot. <br />
Some drugs <i>happen to</i> cross the BBB even though we don't want them to, while some others drugs (most of psychoactive drugs) are specifically designed to do so.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-cetirizine">
<p>
Cetirizine, one of the most famouse antihistamines, is what first came to my mind to write this article.
it can cause drowsiness, although it's generally known for being <i>less sedating</i> compared to those <i>first-generation</i> antihistamines, which aren't really a preferred choice to treat your allergy.
</p>

<p>
It is indded far less fat-soluble, but it still penetrates the BBB, entering the CNS.
</p>

<p>
One of the important roles Histamine plays is that it regulates wakefulness and alertness in the brain.
Therefore, Cetirizine blocking histamine H1 receptors in the CNS, even to a small extent, would result in drowsiness and sedation.

<h5 id="diphenhydramine"><span class="section-number-5">3.1.1.1.</span> Diphenhydramine</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-diphenhydramine">
<p>
Diphenhydramine is the 1st gen. antihistamine with anticholinergic toxicity.
Although it's labled as an antihistamine, it's more often used as a sleep inducer today.
The scary part is that it's quite anticholinergic and there are strong evidences that its chronic use is related to dementia.

<p>
In my opinion, it's unfortunate that in most countries you can buy this without doctor's prescription considering the risk after a long term use is significant.

<p>
There are many studies published, indicating that the long-term use of those drug, especially anticholinergic ones is <i>strongly</i> associated with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7821204/">an increased risk of dementia</a>.

<div id="outline-container-adderall" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="adderall"><span class="section-number-4">3.1.2.</span> Adderall</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-adderall">
<p>
The notorious drug Adderall uses a similar mechanism.
It's designed to cross the BBB and directly stimulates the release of dopamine, disrupting the brain's natural reuptake process.
</p>

<p>
That results in a hyper-alertness, stronger than the <i>regular</i> alertness caused by caffeine as described above, which merely blocks some adenosine receptors.
</p>

<h4 id="caffein-and-coffee"><span class="section-number-4">3.1.3.</span> Caffein and coffee</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-caffein-and-coffee">
<p>
Arguably, the most loved drug among people today is coffee, though you don't need a doctor's prescription.
Caffeine in tne coffee can cross the BBB and block adenosine receptors.
</p>

<p>
Adenosine makes you feel calm, but when caffeine blocks its receptors, your brain can't calm down, resulting in a state of alertness.
Too much caffeine can lead to excessive alertness, causing side effects like insomnia, as shown below:
