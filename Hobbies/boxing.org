I started practicing boxing as a hobby a couple years ago.

Since that I realized it offers numerous beneifts for self-discipline, health, and my stress management.
It's tough, requiring a high level of dedication and consistency through which it instills discipline in all areas of life.

Not only that, but I think boxing is also an excellent way to stay physically healthy.
This sport provides a full-body workout with strength, agility, and endurance.

Most importantly it's really a powerful tool for stress management.
I used to run at night, when I'm under stress. I feel like I discovered a better method though.

It definitely triggers the release of endorph at a greater scale lifting my mood and getting ready for the next day's work.
Through this hobby ones can find a balance between physical exertion and mental relaxation for a more harmonious life style.

Someday, I might go for BJJ as well.
