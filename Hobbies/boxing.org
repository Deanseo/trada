I started boxing as a hobby a couple of years ago after watching a MMA fight that captivated me with its intensity and strategy.
Since then, I've realized it offers numerous benefits for self-discipline, health, and stress management.

It's tough, requiring a high level of dedication and consistency, but through this, it instills discipline in all areas of life.

I think it's an excellent way to stay physically healthy.
The sport provides a full-body workout, increasing strength, agility, and endurance.

Most importantly, it's a powerful tool for stress management, helping to wash frustration and anxiety away through sweat
while promoting mental clarity and resilience.
I used to run at night whenever I was stressed, but I feel like I've discovered a better method now.

Boxing definitely triggers the release of endorphins on a greater scale,
lifting my mood and helping me get ready for the next day's work.

Through this hobby, one can find a balance between physical exertion and mental relaxation for a more holistic lifestyle.

Someday, I might try Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) as well, as it offers a different approach to combat sports, focusing more on ground control rather than striking. It could complement boxing by enhancing my ability to stay calm under pressure.
